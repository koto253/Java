# A Basic Calculator
In this project, you will use classes, methods, and objects to create a simple arithmetic calculator. The calculator will be able to:
*  Add two integers
*  Subtract two integers
*  Multiply two integers
*  Divide two integers
*  Apply the modulo operator on two integers

## Instruction

+ Create a public class called Calculator.
+ Inside of the class, create a Calculator() constructor. You can leave the contents of the constructor empty.
+ Next, create a public method that returns an int and call it add().
+ The add() method should accept two int parameters. For example: int a, int b.
+ The add method should add the two integer parameters that a user will specify. Inside of the add method, return the sum of a and b.
+ Next, create another similar method called subtract(). The subtract() method should accept two int parameters, just like the add() method does.
+ Inside of the subtract() method, return the difference of a and b.
+ Create another method called multiply(). The multiply() method should accept two int parameters.
+ Inside of the multiply method, return the product of a and b.
+ Create another method called divide(). It should accept two int parameters.
+ Inside of the divide() function, return a divided by b.
+ Create another method called modulo. It should accept two int parameters.
+ Inside of the modulo() function, return a modulo b.
+ Next, create a main() method. Can you remember all the keywords necessary for a main() method?
+ Inside of main(), create a Calculator object called myCalculator.
+ Print out the value of calling the add() method on myCalculator. Pass in 5 and 7 as parameters.
+ On the next line, print out the value of calling the subtract() method on myCalculator. Pass in 45 and 11 as parameters.
